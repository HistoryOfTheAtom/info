        <p>Marie Curie won her first Nobel Prize in 1903 with her husband (Pierre Curie) </p>
        <p>It was awarded to her because of her work on radiation phenomena. </p>
        <p> Although she had to split this prize because Becquerel (another scientist discovered spontaneous radiation. </p>
        <p> In 1911 she won it again, but this time for chemistry instead of physics. </p>
        <p> This was for discovering the elements polonium and radium. </p>
        <p>As well as being the first woman to win the Nobel Prize, she was also the first to have a PhD in Physics in France. </p>
            
           
           <p> Curie was the first to unravel the mysteries of radioactivity. </p>
           <p> She also made significant contributions to the understanding of atomic structure. </p>
           <p>The discovery of Polonium and Radium was done by her as well. </p>
           <p> 1914, World War 1 broke out, Marie Curie saw potential in quick X-rays of the battlefield </p>
            <p>Along side with her daughter they developed radiological vehicles. </p>
                <p>The mobile X-ray units were estimated to help over one million allied</p>

       <h2>The Gold Foil Experiment</h2>
        <p>In this experiment thin gold leaf was suspended in a vacuum with alpha particles (a form of nuclear radiation with a large positive charge â€“ 2 neutrons and 2 protons joined together)being fired at it. Rutherford expected the alpha particles to pass straight through the thin foil </p>
      <p>Results: 
        Alpha particles did pass straight through the thin foil. Rutherford determined from this that most of the atom is empty space </p>
        <p>A small number of alpha particles were being deflected by large angles (>4). From this Rutherford realised that there was a concentration of positive charge in the atom as like charges repel so the positive alpha particles were being repelled by positive charges. </p>
      <p>An even smaller number of alpha particles came straight back off the foil. This means that the positive charge and mass are concentrated in a tiny volume (i.e . The nucleus). A tiny number means less chance of exact collision.</p>
